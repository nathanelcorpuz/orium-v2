# Orium — Product Spec

**The single source of truth.** Product definition, data model, engine rules, and the full roadmap live here. Working rules for Claude live in CLAUDE.md; open bugs in BUGS.md. (This file absorbed and replaced SPEC2.md in July 2026; task numbers are continuous across both.)

## What Orium is

Orium is a family cash-flow forecasting app. Users manually enter their account balances, recurring bills, income, debt payments, savings goals, one-off expenses, and spending budgets. Orium projects every upcoming transaction in chronological order and shows the **running future balance** at each date, color-coded by safety level. The core promise: *know exactly how much money you'll have on any future date, and never miss a bill.*

v1 (shipped) rebuilt the original Orium (github.com/nathanelcorpuz/orium) on a cleaner engine. The current work replaces its fixed 4-frequency recurrence with calendar-style rules (Phase 6A), converts budgets to replenishing cycles (Phase 6B), and restyles everything Notion-like (Phase 7).

## Tech stack (fixed — do not add alternatives)

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Supabase: Postgres, Auth (email/password), Row Level Security
- `@supabase/supabase-js` + `@supabase/ssr` per official Next.js patterns
- Vitest for unit tests (engine only)
- No other dependencies without asking the user first

## Core design rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Money is integer centavos.** Never floats. `₱1,500.00` = `150000`. Format only at the UI layer. Default currency `₱`, user-configurable.
2. **Due dates are calendar dates** — `YYYY-MM-DD` strings / Postgres `date`. Never UTC timestamps for due dates.
3. **Rules, not pre-generated rows.** Recurrence is stored as rules; occurrences are computed on the fly.
4. **The forecast engine is pure TypeScript** in `src/lib/engine/` — no database or network calls, fully unit-tested.
5. **Every table has `user_id`** with owner-only RLS.

## Data model (Postgres — migrations in `supabase/migrations/`)

### `balances`
Real money accounts. `id, user_id, name, amount (bigint centavos), comments, created_at, updated_at`.

### `recurring_items`
One row per recurring rule (bills, income, debt, savings). Amount sign convention: income positive; bills/debt/savings negative (DB-enforced).

Identity: `id, user_id, name, type (bill|income|debt|savings), amount, comments`.

**Recurrence rule (new model, live from migration 0004):**
| column | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `interval` | int ≥ 1 | repeat every N units |
| `unit` | enum | `day` \| `week` \| `month` \| `year` |
| `weekdays` | int[] nullable | 0=Sun…6=Sat; required when unit=week (multi-select) |
| `days_of_month` | int[] nullable | 1–31 for unit=month; days beyond a month's length clamp to its last day |
| `ordinal` + `ordinal_weekday` | int nullable pair | nth-weekday monthly rules: ordinal 1–4 or −1 (last); (3,2)=third Tuesday, (−1,5)=last Friday. unit=month uses **either** `days_of_month` **or** the ordinal pair |
| `start_date` | date | anchor; first possible occurrence |
| `ends_type` | enum | `never` \| `on_date` \| `after_count` |
| `end_date` | date nullable | set iff ends_type=on_date |
| `occurrence_count` | int nullable | set iff ends_type=after_count |

**Legacy columns `frequency`/`day_of_month`/`weekday` are gone** — dropped by migration 0005 (2026-07-21) once T35 shipped. Backfill mapping used to populate the new columns before the drop: monthly → (1, month, days=[day_of_month, falling back to start_date's day]) · weekly → (1, week) and biweekly → (2, week), both with weekdays=[dow(start_date)] — **not** the legacy `weekday` column, which the v1 engine never read and which may have been null or disagreed with the real schedule · semi_monthly_15_30 → (1, month, days=[15,30]); existing rows got `ends_type='on_date'` + their then-current end_date.

### `occurrence_overrides`
Per-instance edits to a recurring rule (calendar-exception style). `id, user_id, recurring_item_id (fk), original_date, new_date, new_amount, new_name, skipped (bool)`. Unique on (`recurring_item_id`, `original_date`).

### `one_off_items`
"Extras" — single dated transactions. `id, user_id, name, amount (signed), due_date, comments`.

### `settlements`
"History" — what actually happened, written when the user settles an occurrence or logs a budget spend. `id, user_id, source_type (recurring|one_off|budget), source_id, name, type (bill|income|debt|savings|extra|budget), forecasted_amount, actual_amount, forecasted_date, actual_date, forecasted_balance`. Settling a recurring occurrence also writes a `skipped` override so it leaves the forecast.

### `budgets` (T36 columns live; app still on the pre-6B baseline until T37/T38)
`id, user_id, name, created_at`, plus (still pre-6B, current app): `monthly_allocation (bigint ≥ 0)`. Plus (T36, migration 0006, added 2026-07-21): `allocation (bigint ≥ 0, NOT NULL, backfilled 1:1 from monthly_allocation)`, `carryover_enabled (bool, default true)`, `linked_income_id (uuid nullable, REFERENCES recurring_items ON DELETE SET NULL — app-level rule: must point at a type=income item, not DB-enforced)`, and the full recurrence rule shape (all nullable — `start_date, interval, unit, weekdays, days_of_month, ordinal, ordinal_weekday, ends_type, end_date, occurrence_count`; `interval`/`unit`/`start_date`/`ends_type` are constrained to move together as a complete-or-nothing group). `monthly_allocation` is dropped by migration 0007 once T38 ships and the app no longer reads it — same additive-then-drop pattern as 0004/0005.

### `budget_entries`
Logged spends. `id, user_id, budget_id (fk cascade), entry_date, amount (bigint > 0 = money spent), note, created_at`. Unchanged by 6B.

### `reminders`
`id, user_id, text, created_at`.

### `preferences`
One row per user, created on signup. `user_id pk, currency (default '₱'), balance_ranges (bigint[] — 5 ascending centavo thresholds: [danger, low, medium, high, higher]; balance ≤ ranges[0] = danger, above ranges[4] = highest)`.

## The forecast engine (`src/lib/engine/`)

Pure functions. `generateForecast({ balances, recurringItems, overrides, oneOffs, budgets?, budgetEntries?, today, horizon }) → ForecastRow[]` where each row is `{ sourceType, sourceId, originalDate, name, amount, dueDate, type, runningBalance }`.

Pipeline: expand each recurring rule from `max(today, start_date)` to the rule's end (capped at horizon) → apply overrides (move/change/skip) → merge one-offs dated today or later → merge budget rows (below) → sort by due date (stable, date only) → running balance = sum of `balances.amount` plus cumulative signed amounts, always integer centavos. Occurrences strictly before `today` are excluded (they belong in settlements).

### Recurrence expansion (target semantics, T33–T34)
- **day**: start_date, then every `interval` days.
- **week**: weeks anchored to the week containing start_date; every `interval` weeks emit each selected weekday; skip dates before start_date.
- **month**: months anchored to start_date's month, stepping by `interval`; emit each clamped day in `days_of_month` (day > month length → last day of month), or the resolved nth-weekday date (`ordinal` 1–4 or −1=last + `ordinal_weekday`).
- **year**: start_date's month/day every `interval` years; Feb 29 → Feb 28 in non-leap years.
- **ends**: `never` → generate to horizon; `on_date` inclusive; `after_count` → stop after N emitted occurrences.
- `ends_type=never` items are excluded from finite "remaining total" stats (e.g. total remaining debt).

The old fixed 4-frequency expansion (monthly/weekly/biweekly/semi_monthly_15_30) is gone — removed along with its columns by migration 0005 once T35 shipped. Every `recurring_items` row now uses this rule shape exclusively; `RecurringItem` has no legacy fields.

### Monthly-equivalent summary stat
Summary cards ("Total Monthly Income/Bills") use integer multipliers, never fractional math (a displayed `86,666.7` means float leakage — bug). Generalized form: `occurrencesPerMonth = round(f)` where f = day: 30/interval · week: (4 × len(weekdays))/interval · month: (len(days_of_month) or 1)/interval · year: 1/(12 × interval); minimum 0. `monthlyEquivalent = amount × occurrencesPerMonth` (integer × integer). Old presets yield ×4 (weekly), ×2 (biweekly), ×2 (semi-monthly), ×1 (monthly). The *forecast* keeps real occurrence dates (a 5-Saturday month genuinely shows 5 incomes) — only summary stats use multipliers.

### Budgets v2 engine (T37 — built in `budgetCycles.ts`, a new module alongside the untouched `budgets.ts`)
A budget replenishes at each **cycle boundary**; everything derives from logged spends — no manual resets. `budgets.ts`'s T24/T25 monthly-only functions (`currentMonthBudgetStatus`, `expandBudgetOccurrences`) are kept exactly as they were rather than rewritten in place — they're still what the currently-deployed Budgets page calls, and per the T35→0005 incident this session isn't taking chances with a caller it can't fully verify mid-task. T38/T39 do the actual cutover once the UI can produce v2 data; `budgets.ts` gets deleted then, mirroring how `monthly.ts`/`interval.ts`/`semi-monthly.ts` were deleted only once nothing called them.

**Boundary source:** linked income set → that income's *effective* occurrence dates (after overrides — moved dates move the boundary; skipped occurrences produce no reset, the cycle extends). Else own recurrence set → its occurrences. Else (e.g. linked income deleted) → fallback monthly on the 1st + a "needs a schedule" badge in the UI. After the final boundary, the last cycle extends to the horizon.

**Cycle math:** cycle k spans [boundaryₖ, boundaryₖ₊₁). Entries belong to the cycle containing entry_date; boundary-date entries belong to the **new** cycle; entries before the first boundary count toward the first cycle. `available₀ = allocation`; `availableₖ = allocation + (carryover_enabled ? availableₖ₋₁ − spentₖ₋₁ : 0)` — carryover may be negative. `remaining = max(available_current − spent_current, 0)`; `over = max(spent_current − available_current, 0)`.

**Forecast integration:** current cycle → one row per budget, "{name} — remaining this cycle", amount −remaining, dated today, omitted when remaining = 0. Each future boundary within the horizon → "{name} — allocation", amount −allocation, dated the boundary. Budget rows are type `budget` (teal), not editable, not settleable.

**Logging a spend** writes a `budget_entries` row AND a settlement (source_type `budget`, type `budget`, name = budget name + note, actual_amount = −amount, actual_date = entry_date, forecasted fields mirror actuals, forecasted_balance = 0). History renders budget rows with a "budget" tag, no forecast-vs-actual comparison.

### Peaks and Drops
One row per year in the horizon, one column per calendar month (Jan–Dec); each cell shows that month's max (peak) and min (drop) running balance, color-coded by `balance_ranges`.

### Required test coverage (Vitest, all must stay green)
v1 core: day-31 monthly across Feb/Apr (clamping) · leap-year Feb 29 · semi-monthly across February · biweekly anchored mid-week across a month boundary · overrides move/change/skip · running balance with mixed signs · end_date cutoff and future start_date.
6A (T33–T34): every-2-weeks multi-weekday · days=[15,30] in February · interval-3 months · after_count · never→horizon · nth-weekday incl. last-X · generalized monthlyEquivalent.
6B (T37): linked-income boundaries incl. moved + skipped occurrence · own-schedule weekly cycles · fallback · income-ends extension · carryover on/off/negative · remaining/over · boundary-date entry · integer math.

## Pages & features

All pages require auth; unauthenticated users go to `/login`. Type colors: income green, debt orange, savings blue, extra purple, budget teal, bill default text.

1. **Auth**: sign up (email verification), log in, log out, password reset.
2. **Dashboard** (`/`): Total Balance, Total Monthly Bills, Total Monthly Income cards; per-balance breakdown; Remaining Debt + debt-free date + days until; Peaks and Drops grid. Greeting shows profile name, else email local part. *Planned (T40): compact "Budgets this cycle" card (name + mini bar + remaining).*
3. **Forecast** (`/forecast`): total balance + editable balance chips; the full occurrence list color-coded by `balance_ranges` (danger = dark, low = red tint, medium = white, high→highest = deepening green); row click opens Edit/Settle modal (edit → override; settle → actual amount/date → settlement). Right sidebar: reminders CRUD. *Planned (T39): Budgets panel above Reminders — per budget: name, carryover badge when nonzero carried in ("+₱700 carried over"), progress bar (spent vs available; over state = full red bar + "Over by ₱X · next cycle starts at ₱Y"), "₱X left · resets {date}" or "resets with {income name} · {date}", quick Log-spend (amount, date=today, note).*
4. **Balances / Bills / Income / Debt / Savings / Extras** (`/balances`, `/bills`, `/income`, `/debt`, `/savings`, `/extra`): CRUD pages; each shows its summary total. *Planned (T35): all four recurring forms use the shared recurrence picker; each row shows a human-readable rule summary ("Every 2 weeks on Sat · until Apr 2030").*
5. **Budgets** (`/budgets`): CRUD + per-budget current-month entries + log spend (current page is the pre-6B baseline). *Planned (T38): replenish-source UI — modal with Name, Allocation, "Replenishes" segmented control ("With an income" → select from income items, helper: resets each time it lands / "On a schedule" → recurrence picker), carryover checkbox; per-budget current-cycle entries with delete; "needs a schedule" badge state.*
6. **History** (`/history`): settlements table — forecasted vs actual amount/date, forecasted balance, type. *Planned (T40): budget-tag rendering.*
7. **Settings** (`/settings`): profile, preferences (currency, balance ranges), log out, delete account (removes all user data).

### Recurrence picker (shared component, T35)
Used by Bills, Income, Debt, Savings, Budgets. Select with contextual presets computed from the chosen start date — "Monthly on the 21st", "Weekly on Tuesday", "Every 2 weeks on Tuesday", "Every 15th and 30th", "Monthly on the third Tuesday", "Custom…". Custom panel: Repeat every [N] [unit]; weekday chips (week); day list or nth-weekday (month); Ends: Never / On [date] / After [N] occurrences.

### Phase 7 — Notion-style redesign (restyle only, no behavior changes)
Notion palette (`#37352F` text, `#E9E9E7` hairlines, `#2383E2` accent, soft pill backgrounds), Inter, 14px base, full-width shell with 240px sidebar, tables with hairline dividers and hover `#F1F1EF`. Budget teal `#0B6E99`. Peaks and Drops keeps the v1 year×month pill grid.

**Date display format**: replace every raw `YYYY-MM-DD` shown to the user with a human-readable format — full dates as "Jun 1, 2025" (Month Day, Year), month-only dates (e.g. a recurrence rule's "until" suffix, a debt-free date rounded to the month) as "Jun 2025" (Month Year). Storage/computation stays `YYYY-MM-DD` everywhere per the core design rules — this is purely a UI formatting change, which is why it's scoped to Phase 7 rather than done ad hoc. `recurrenceSummary.ts`'s internal `formatMonthYear` already produces the "Jun 2025" style; export it (or a shared equivalent) for reuse instead of duplicating. Applies wherever T28–T31 touch a page showing dates: Bills/Income/Debt/Savings row summaries and start/end dates, Forecast due dates, History forecasted/actual dates, Dashboard's debt-free date.

## Operations

- **Migrations are written as files** in `supabase/migrations/` and applied by Claude directly via the connected Supabase MCP integration (falls back to the user pasting into the SQL editor if that connection isn't available in a session — see CLAUDE.md "Hard rules"). Back up first via `pg_dump` only when real data is at stake.
- **The recurrence migration was split across two files**, each paste-and-run whole: `0004_recurrence_rules.sql` (add columns + backfill, non-destructive) and `0005_recurrence_drop_legacy_after_t35.sql` (enforce NOT NULL + drop legacy columns). Both are applied — 0004 on 2026-07-21, 0005 the same day once T35 was live in production.
- **Sample data**: `supabase/seed.sql` fills every feature with a realistic family dataset (run after 0004; re-runnable; all seed rows share the id prefix `00000000-0000-4000-a000-` for easy wiping).

## Roadmap

### Before MVP launch (needs discussion)
- **Interactive onboarding experience for new users.** Flagged as a priority by the user (2026-07-21) — not yet scoped or designed. Needs a dedicated discussion with the user on approach/flow before it becomes a task with its own T-number.

### Done
- **Phases 0–4 (T1–T21)**: v1 built and deployed to Vercel — schema, pure engine + tests, all CRUD pages, Forecast/History/Dashboard, settings, responsive/polish, legal pages.
- **Phase 5 (T22–T23)**: integer-multiplier monthly totals (Bug #1); greeting name fallback (Bug #2).
- **T24–T25**: budgets v1 tables + engine (monthly-only, no rollover) — the baseline Phase 6B converts.
- **T41**: sample data seed (`supabase/seed.sql`).
- ~~T26–T27~~ **cancelled** — superseded by Phase 6B; never build them.

### Phase 6A — Flexible recurrence (done)
- [x] **T32.** Migration 0004: recurrence columns + enums + constraints + backfill; legacy-column drop split out into migration 0005 (runs only after T35). *0004 applied and seeded 2026-07-21; 0005 (drops legacy `frequency`/`day_of_month`/`weekday`) applied 2026-07-21 via the connected Supabase MCP integration, after T35 shipped to production. Verified via `list_tables` + `get_advisors` — legacy columns gone, `interval`/`unit`/`ends_type` now `NOT NULL`, all 18 rows intact, no new advisories.*
- [x] **T33.** Engine: day/week/month(days)/year expansion + ends rules; port existing tests; add 6A cases (list above). *`src/lib/engine/recurrence.ts`; originally dispatched per item alongside a legacy fallback path (new engine when migrated, old monthly/weekly/biweekly/semi-monthly functions otherwise) so pre-T35 forms kept working. That dispatch and the legacy functions were removed once migration 0005 dropped the columns they depended on — `recurrence.ts` is now the only expansion path.*
- [x] **T34.** Engine: nth-weekday resolution (incl. last-X) + generalized `monthlyEquivalent`; tests. *Ordinal resolution in `recurrence.ts`; generalized formula in `monthlyTotals.ts` (same migrated/legacy dispatch pattern as T33's `forecast.ts`).*
- [x] **T35.** Recurrence picker wired into all four CRUD forms; human-readable rule summary per row. *Browser-verified 2026-07-21 after a dev server restart; pushed and deployed to production the same day. Migration 0005 is ready for the user to run — see its header for steps.*

### Phase 6B — Budgets v2 (after 6A)
- [x] **T36.** ALTER migration on budgets (allocation, carryover, linked income, recurrence columns). Existing rows keep working via fallback until edited. *Migration 0006 applied 2026-07-21 via the connected Supabase MCP integration, additive-only (kept `monthly_allocation` in place rather than renaming, so the currently-deployed Budgets page needed zero code changes — chosen specifically after the T35→0005 outage). Verified via `execute_sql` — all 4 budgets backfilled correctly (`allocation = monthly_allocation`), `carryover_enabled=true`, `unit=null`. Drop-legacy migration 0007 written but not run until T38.*
- [x] **T37.** Engine rework: boundary/cycle/carryover model + tests (list above). *`src/lib/engine/budgetCycles.ts` + tests (20 cases covering the full required list). New module, not a rewrite of `budgets.ts` — see "Budgets v2 engine" above for why. Two real bugs caught and fixed before landing: (1) the fallback schedule's anchor was a fixed distant-past constant, which with carryover enabled would have silently accumulated decades of phantom "unused allocation" — fixed by anchoring to the budget's own `createdAt` instead; (2) a moved override could shift a boundary to either side of the query window and get miscounted — fixed by expanding generously past the window then filtering the *effective* (post-override) dates, not the raw ones. `Budget` type extended with the new fields (backward-compatible — `Pick<Budget,...>`-typed old functions are structurally unaffected); one existing test literal updated to match. 120/120 tests, tsc, eslint all clean. Not yet wired into forecast.ts/forecastData.ts — that's T39.*
- [x] **T38.** Budgets page: CRUD + replenish-source UI + entries + log spend. *Rewrote `BudgetModal`/`BudgetCard`/`actions.ts`/`page.tsx`: "Replenishes" segmented control (with-an-income select vs. on-a-schedule `RecurrencePicker` reuse), carryover checkbox, "Needs a schedule" badge, current-cycle entries with delete (also removes the matching settlement so History doesn't keep a phantom spend — matched by source_type/source_id/actual_date/actual_amount since there's no FK). `monthly_allocation` still written as a mirror of `allocation` on every save (stays DB `NOT NULL` until migration 0007 runs). Browser-verified 2026-07-21 by the user directly (Browser-pane automation was stuck against this project's dev server — known issue, see project memory — so verification was manual). Caught and fixed a real T37 bug in the process: linked-income/own-schedule boundaries walked the schedule's own history from its start date rather than the budget's, so a budget linked to a months-old income with carryover on and nothing spent accumulated one full allocation per phantom pre-existence cycle (₱145,000 available on a ₱5,000 budget, reported and confirmed fixed by the user). Fix: boundaries are now clipped to the most recent one at-or-before the budget's own `createdAt`. New regression test added; 121/121 tests, tsc, eslint clean. `budgets.ts` (v1 engine) now has no live callers left but is deliberately not deleted yet, and migration 0007 (drops `monthly_allocation`) deliberately not run yet — both deferred to a follow-up the user explicitly confirms, per the T35→0005 outage precedent.*
- [ ] **T39.** Forecast: budgets panel + budget rows + quick log-spend.
- [ ] **T40.** Dashboard card + History budget tags + empty states; verify summary stats ignore budgets except through forecast rows.
- [ ] **T42.** Editable transactions + stale-override cleanup, logged 2026-07-21 (user request, after T39). Two parts:
  - **A — stale-override cleanup (Bills/Income/Debt/Savings, and Budgets once B lands):** editing an item's rule directly from its own page (not via a Forecast per-occurrence edit) checks each of its existing `occurrence_overrides` against the *new* rule and deletes only the ones whose `original_date` the new rule no longer produces — everything still valid (including already-settled/skipped ones) is left untouched. A shared helper wired into `updateIncome`/`updateBill`/`updateDebt`/`updateSavings`. Deleting a stale override never touches `settlements`/History, which is a separate permanent record.
  - **B — editable budget forecast rows + editable logged spends:** budget rows in the Forecast list are currently "not editable, not settleable" (see "Forecast integration" above) — this changes that. New migration: `budget_occurrence_overrides` (mirrors `occurrence_overrides`: `budget_id`, `original_date`, `new_date`, `new_amount`, `skipped`), keyed by each row's cycle boundary date (the *current* cycle's row keys on `currentCycleStart`, which stays stable all cycle even though its displayed date is "today"). `expandBudgetCycleOccurrences` (`budgetCycles.ts`) applies these the same way `forecast.ts` applies `occurrence_overrides` for recurring items. Budget rows become clickable again in Forecast, reusing the Edit pattern. `budget_entries` gets an edit action (currently create/delete only) on both the Budgets page and the Forecast sidebar panel. Editing a budget's own allocation/schedule runs Part A's cleanup against this new table. Update the "Forecast integration" section once built.

### Phase 7 — Notion-style redesign (last)
- [ ] **T28.** Foundation: tokens, Inter, full-width shell, sidebar, base components — incl. recurrence picker, segmented control, progress bars.
- [ ] **T29.** Restyle Dashboard + Forecast (list, chips, modals, reminders, budgets panel).
- [ ] **T30.** Restyle all CRUD pages (Balances, Bills, Income, Debt, Savings, Extras, Budgets).
- [ ] **T31.** Restyle Auth, Settings, History; consistency pass; screenshot review with the user before closing.

### Out of scope
Payments/subscriptions, mobile app, notifications, bank sync, multi-user families.
